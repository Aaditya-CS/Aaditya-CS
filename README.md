My name is Aaditya CS, but I'm also identified by my online username, KoLdeN. Here are some fun facts about myself!

   - ðŸ”­ I'm an 20 year old male student pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering.
   - ðŸŒ± I've always been passionate about computers, spending tons of hours playing games and watching movies.
   - âš¡ I'm learning programming with a passion and plan to make it as my profession.
   - ðŸ‘¯ I'm keeping my cards open when it comes to specialising in fields of programming, but I'm very keen when it comes to Game development and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
